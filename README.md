#Exercise 3: JavaScript / Jquery 

Please create a simple navigation menu - the layout of the nav is up to you. Include four navigation items: HOME, INVENTORY, ABOUT US, CONTACT. When 'Inventory' is clicked, a dropdown is revealed with the items: NEW, USED, CARS, TRUCKS, SUV'S. Be sure to include adequate user feedback, with CSS transitions, psudo-classes, etc. The navigation must be aesthetically pleasing. Please avoid using CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.).
